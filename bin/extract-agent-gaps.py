"""Stage 1 of the nightly knowledge-gap loop: extract topics/facts the AGENT was
confused about from recent sessions, append-only to a dense log.

Signal = the agent's own confusion: a fact it got wrong, a topic it was uncertain
on, a thing the user had to correct. NOT user-experience friction.

Cheap+wide half of a CAM loop (slow lane via arc-llm-proxy at 127.0.0.1:8091,
`hygiene` alias). The smart half — rank by severity x frequency, then reconcile
against AGENTS.md / MEMORY.md / ke — runs as a stage in nightly-self-improve.sh.

Output: one dense pipe-delimited line per gap, appended to GAP_LOG:
  YYYY-MM-DD | topic | one-line fact-the-agent-was-confused-about | session8
Append-only: the log is the accumulating frequency signal stage 2 ranks over.

PROMPT = """You are auditing a coding-agent transcript for the AGENT's OWN knowledge gaps.

Report only TOPICS or FACTS the agent was confused about: something it got factually wrong, was visibly uncertain about, guessed at, or that the user had to correct. Focus on durable, reusable knowledge (an API's behavior, a provider's limits, a config path, a tool's contract, a project constraint) — NOT one-off typos or transient state.

A gap requires EVIDENCE OF ERROR in the transcript: a wrong action, a visible guess, a retry after failure, or a user correction. An agent that states a fact correctly, cites a rule it is following, or narrates a precaution it took is NOT a gap — it already had that knowledge. Skip it. Recited doctrine (rotation rules, timestamp handling, which runner to use) is the single largest source of false gaps; report it only if the agent actually got it wrong first. Harness-injected notices are the second: usage/spend-limit warnings, credit-reset times, quota and rate-limit messages, and API errors are emitted by the runtime, not by the agent — they are never gaps, even when they look off-topic for the transcript. Skip them.

For each, give: a short topic (2-5 words, the reusable subject) and a one-line fact stating what the correct knowledge is (what the agent should have known).

Return STRICT JSON: {"gaps": [{"topic": "<2-5 word subject>", "fact": "<one line: the correct fact the agent lacked>"}]}
Empty list if the agent showed no knowledge gaps. No prose outside the JSON.
