# arc-skills doc-drift guard.

# Fails the gate on known falsified-claim patterns in skill markdown. Each
# rule is a grep that has caught real drift that slipped past the
# dream / token-waste / recency-gate self-heal loops. The test is
# intentionally small and explicit — add a rule when a new drift shape
# appears, with a one-line comment naming the commit that introduced it.
#
# Run locally before opening a PR:
#   bin/arc-skills-doc-drift.sh
# Exit 0 = clean, 1 = at least one drift pattern matched.
